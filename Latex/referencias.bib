	abstract = {State space models with non-stationary processes and/or fixed regression effects require a state vector with diffuse initial conditions. Different likelihood functions can be adopted for the estimation of parameters in time-series models with diffuse initial conditions. In this article, we consider profile, diffuse and marginal likelihood functions. The marginal likelihood function is defined as the likelihood function of a transformation of the data vector. The transformation is not unique. The diffuse likelihood is a marginal likelihood for a data transformation that may depend on parameters. Therefore, the diffuse likelihood cannot be used generally for parameter estimation. The marginal likelihood function is based on an orthonormal data transformation that does not depend on parameters. Here we develop a marginal likelihood function for state space models that can be evaluated by the Kalman filter. The so-called diffuse Kalman filter is designed for computing the diffuse likelihood function. We show that a minor modification of the diffuse Kalman filter is needed for the evaluation of our marginal likelihood function. Diffuse and marginal likelihood functions have better small sample properties compared with the profile likelihood function for the estimation of parameters in linear time series models. The results in our article confirm the earlier findings and show that the diffuse likelihood function is not appropriate for a range of state space model specifications.},

	Resumo={Neste livro, Andrew Harvey se propõe a fornecer uma teoria unificada e abrangente de modelos estruturais de séries temporais. Diferentemente dos modelos ARIMA tradicionais, os modelos estruturais de séries temporais consistem explicitamente em componentes não observados, como tendências e sazonalidades, que têm uma interpretação direta. Como resultado, a metodologia de seleção de modelos associada a modelos estruturais é muito mais próxima da metodologia econométrica. A ligação com a econometria é ainda mais estreita pela maneira natural como os modelos podem ser estendidos para incluir variáveis explicativas e lidar com séries temporais multivariadas. Do ponto de vista técnico, os modelos de espaço de estados e o filtro de Kalman desempenham um papel fundamental no tratamento estatístico de modelos estruturais de séries temporais. O livro inclui um tratamento detalhado do filtro de Kalman. Essa técnica foi originalmente desenvolvida em engenharia de controle, mas está se tornando cada vez mais importante em áreas como economia e pesquisa operacional. Este livro se preocupa principalmente com a modelagem de séries temporais econômicas e sociais e com a abordagem dos problemas específicos que o tratamento dessas séries apresenta. As propriedades dos modelos e as técnicas metodológicas utilizadas para selecioná-los são ilustradas com diversas aplicações. Elas variam desde a modelagem de tendências e ciclos em séries temporais macroeconômicas dos EUA até uma avaliação dos efeitos da legislação sobre cintos de segurança no Reino Unido},

	abstract = {Summary
	The flood-pulse of the large rivers in Central Amazonia triggers ecological processes of the floodplain systems inducing a severe seasonality in the annual cycle between the aquatic and the terrestrial phase. The nutrient-rich floodplains (várzea) have the highest human population density in Amazonia and economic activities such as fishing, agriculture, pasture and timber extraction are directly associated with water-level fluctuations. The discharge of many tropical river systems responds to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) originating from the tropical Pacific. Several studies show a strong relationship between the flooding regime of Amazonian rivers and ENSO-indices, such as the meteorological Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). During warm ENSO-phases (El Niño) flood-levels are lowered and aquatic phases are shortened, while high and prolonged flooding is associated to cold ENSO-phases (La Niña). Here we present retrospective forecasts of the maximum water level in Central Amazonia from 1903 to 2004 – generally occurring in the second half of June – and the length of the aquatic phase along the flood-gradient by models based on the SOI and SST anomalies of the El Niño 3.4 region in February, four months before its appearance. The forecast of the flood-pulse allows also predicting parameters correlated with the flood-pulse (e.g., tree growth, biogeochemical cycles) and increases the efficiency in planning and executing of economic activities by the human population (e.g., fishery, timber extraction, agriculture).}}

However, due to the complex nature and limited knowledge, the conventional hydrological model for flood forecasting purposes faces drawbacks in terms of technical difficulties. Hence, it is essential to have a model which can provide a considerably high level of accuracy for flood forecasting. This study selected the area between the Xiangtan station and Changsha station, located in Xiangjiang River as the study area. Recurrent neural network (RNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were applied for model development purposes. The models were used to forecast the flood disasters occurring in 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2022 for 1h, 6h and 12h in advance. A series of statistical analyses have been conducted to evaluate the model performance. The LSTM model outperformed than the RNN and GRU models. In terms of the overall analysis, the LSTM model achieved relatively good accuracy with a NSE of above 0.98, and RMSE of lower than 0.2 m. In addition, the model with a 6h in advance is the most suitable model to predict the peak flood arrival time with an absolute error of less than 3 hours.}

abstract = {Recent scientific and computational developments have pushed hydrological forecasting systems up to continental and global scales. In this study, we evaluate the potential skill of ensemble streamflow forecasts for flood prediction in South America (SA), with a closer look on some of the large basins of the continent. Medium-range precipitation forecasts from the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System were used to force a continental-scale, fully coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to produce streamflow forecasts up to 15 days in advance. Forecasts were evaluated over a 4-year period against a reference simulation, derived from the hydrological model forced with a gridded precipitation dataset that merges data from multiple sources (MSWEP). To provide a benchmark for assessing the potential skill, forecasts based on the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) technique were produced by running the hydrological model with precipitation data resampled from past MSWEP observations. Overall, ECMWF-based forecasts were skillful mainly at the eastern and southeastern regions of the continent (e.g., São Francisco, Parnaíba, Upper Paraná, Tocantins-Araguaia and Uruguay basins), showing little or no added skill in large rivers draining the Andes such as the Magdalena, Orinoco, Madeira (Amazon) and right-bank tributaries of the Paraguay. In the latter basins, ECMWF-based forecasts largely overestimated the exceedance probabilities of critical thresholds due to a positive bias in the predicted precipitation (in relation to MSWEP), visible mostly during the wet season. In addition, forecasts were found to perform better than ESP in terms of both overall quality and discrimination skill at regions characterized by a warm temperate, fully-humid climate. A direct relation between forecast skill and basin size was not always valid, since the former can vary geographically along tributaries. Limitations and future developments needed for continental-scale hydrological forecasting in SA are also discussed.}

The original statistical forecast models used observed rainfall as the major predictor. We advance the capability to issue skilful forecasts earlier, in February. We develop ensemble forecasts by combining predictor data from observations and seasonal hindcasts. We compare those forecasts against the original statistical forecast models and forecasts using the observed climatology or persistence of predictors. The ensemble-mean forecasts, issued in February, using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) hindcast input, perform similarly as the original forecasts issued in March and gain one month of lead time. The ECMWF-based ensemble forecasts skilfully predict the likelihood of water levels exceeding the severe flood level of 29 m. Forecast performance reduces and ensemble spread increases with increasing lead time from February to January. We conclude that forecasts for Manaus maximum water levels can be produced using combined input from observations and real-time ECMWF forecasts.}

It is therefore critical to advance predictions for flood levels, with adequate lead times, to provide more effective and earlier warnings to safeguard lives and livelihoods. Water-level variations in large, low-lying, free-flowing river systems in the Amazon basin, such as the Negro River, follow large-scale precipitation anomalies. This offers an opportunity to predict maximum water levels using observed antecedent rainfall. This study aims to investigate possible improvements in the performance and extension of the lead time of existing operational statistical forecasts for annual maximum water level of the Negro River at Manaus, occurring between May and July. We develop forecast models using multiple linear regression methods, to produce forecasts that can be issued in March, February and January. Potential predictors include antecedent catchment rainfall and water levels, large-scale modes of climate variability and the long-term linear trend in water levels. Our statistical models gain one month of lead time against existing models for same skill level, but are only moderately better than existing models at similar lead times. All models lose performance at longer lead times, as expected. However, our forecast models can issue skilful operational forecasts in March or earlier. We show the forecasts for the Negro River maximum water level at Manaus for 2020 and 2021.},

Manaus city is bathed by the Negro river, near the confluence of the two rivers, in which the water level of Negro river is controlled by Solim{\~o}es river level. This study proposes to analyse a project named Negro River Flood Warning System that presents a river level or stage forecast about Negro river by the Geological Survey of Brazil in Manaus since 1989, where the annual flood and ebb monitoring process is performed in the Solim{\~o}es, Negro and Amazonas hydrological system. Flood forecasting models are important for the composition of extreme events alerts, as well as for the knowledge of decision-makers, representatives of public agencies and affected communities. Many factors contribute to the flooding event: how the various tributaries are integrated down the river main stem and how the basin behaves during the six months of flooding in the rainy season. For the forecast, it is important to monitor the evolution of the level of rivers such as Negro and Solim{\~o}es, understanding the dynamics of the basin and also the events associated with major floods that have already occurred, as recorded in the historical series of the port of Manaus, all this combined with a statistical methodological approach. In the Manaus alert system, linear regression analysis is used. According to results obtained for the past 15 years, the flood forecast interval reveals that the forecast in 87\% of cases has fulfilled the objective of presenting a stage very close to the water level peak. Furthermore, it was noticed that a height of 27m in Negro river turned to be an alert quota with a return period of 10 years. Once the river water level reaches a height of 29m, it can be considered a ‘severe flood water level’ with a return period of 17 years.},
